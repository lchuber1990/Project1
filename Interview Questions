To connect securely to a remote computer or server, a secure shell (SSH) is used.  An encrypted connection is granted after connection is initiated and credentials
are verified.  Afirewall that is allowing SSH connections to go through instead of blocking the SSH connection can be caused several ways.  During Project 1, I created 
an inbound security rule for the Elk-VM network security group that allowed the SSH action to occur.  All Virtual Machines for project 1 have the same port assigned to 
SSH as well as the same SSH keys.  Since SSH traffic typically goes through port 22, I created a rule that allowed all port 22 traffic.  To increase security, it is 
recommended that the port is changed to a number much higher than 22 and one that is not easily guessed (i.e 222).  In order to change the port, the command 
“sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config” is utilized.  If the port number being used for SSH is changed, that would make the current SSH rule that was created in the Elk-VM network 
security group invalid.  If you were to attempt to SSH into a virtual machine that doesn’t accept SSH connections, it will deny the connection but it would not send a 
rejection notification back. When this issue occurs, it can be due to an error in inbound security rules for that Virtual Machines Network Security group.  In order to 
correct this, an inbound security rule will be made in the appropriate security group that is set to current SSH port with the action Deny selected.  Attempting a SSH 
connection to your Virtual Machine will let you know if the new security group rule was effective.  Nothing is ever immune in the cyber world, as a cyber security 
specialist we can only mitigate risks.  Changing the default SSH port and using unique key pairings are way to mitigate the risk of exposure.
